The figure depicts the manufacturing process of bricks for the erection industry.

Overall, it can be seen that the process which is used to manufacture bricks is a multistep linear process, which consists of seven main stages, namely clay collection, strainer, making bricks, heat, cooling, packaging and distribution.

In the first stage, the clay is collected from the ground by a big crane which is used to make bricks. In stage two, the collection of clay is passed on a roller which is separated the unwanted martial from the clay. Next, the process is started for making bricks where clay, sand and water are mixed and it turned into bricks by either placing them into mould or using a wire cut. Following this, these bricks are passed for heating by an oven for 24-48 hrs.

After the time spent in the oven, it is sent for cooling in a kiln where the temperature is begun from moderate to high. The cooling chamber takes 48-72 hours to complete the process. Finally, the bricks are ready for packaging and delivery for the consumers.
