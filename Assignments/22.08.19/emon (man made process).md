The diagram below shows the way in how to bricks are made for the building industry.


Overall,There are total 7 stages to complete this manufacturing process. Starting with digging up of clay and finishing with delivering of the bricks 
to the customers.


At first,the clays that is used to make bricks is dug from the ground by a large digger machine. After excavation, the clay is going onto a metal grid machine.
it is used to break larges piece of soil to make small pieces. A roller is supporting in this process. Before moulding these small pieces are mixed well by
sand and water. Then the mixture is turned into bricks by either placing into a mould or using a wire cut. Next the bricks are than placed in a drying oven to 
dry for 24-48 hours. in this following stage, the bricks are in a hot and cold precess. They are heated in a kiln at a moderate and then going to a high temparatures
which is formed from 200c to 1300c. Afterward these are moved to cool in a cooling chamber for 48-72 hours.


After all the complex and original processes are over, the bricks are packed and delivered to thier destinations.
