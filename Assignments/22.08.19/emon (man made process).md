The diagram below shows the way bricks are made for the building industry.


Overall, There is a total of 7 stages to complete this manufacturing process. Starting with digging up clay and finishing with delivering the bricks to the customers.


At first, the clay that is used to make bricks is dug from the ground by a large digger machine. After excavation, the clay is sent onto a metal grid machine. it is used to break large pieces of soil into small pieces. A roller is used in this process. Before moulding these small pieces are mixed well with sand and water. Then the mixture is turned into bricks by either placing them into a mould or using a wire cut. Next, the bricks are placed in a drying oven to dry for 24-48 hours. In this following stage, the bricks are kept in a heating and cooling process. They are heated in a kiln at moderate and then high temperature which is ranged from 200c to 1300c. Afterward, these bricks are moved to cool in a cooling chamber for 48-72 hours.


After all the complex processes are over, the bricks are packed and delivered to their destinations.
