The maps represent the evolution of a city which is established in Youngsville between 1980 to 2005. It is situated around a river.

Overall, the difference between the two maps is a complete change from a largely rural area to a mainly urban area.

In the year 1980, the town was a more natural household area with so many trees and personal houses. Within the next 25 years time, a lot of notable changes were seen in this city. The most significant change is that On the west side of the river, in the north, the trees were chopped down in the area next to the hospital and replaced by a park. In addition to this, a stadium and a new railway line were built by demolishing the settlements. Also, a new industrial zone with warehouses and factories has been developed around the school and airport in the south.

On the opposite side, the new railway line started from the south and went to the north in a straight manner. Also, a Marina has been constructed next to the river.
