The map illustrates the urbanization of the coastal city called Youngsville between 1980 to 2005.

Overall, The two maps indicate the changes from a rural area to an urban area within two decades.

In the year 1980, The city of Youngsville was a rural and much greener residential area. There was a huge number of trees and many individual houses. There used to be a woodland beside the airport as well. But during the next 25 years, the town saw significant changes. The trees on the south bank of the river Alanah were chopped down and replaced by an industrial area, where a large number of warehouses and factories were built with car parking. Moreover, the individual houses on the southeast side had been demolished to make skyscrapers.

In contrast, The rail line was expanded to the north bank of the river Alanah and the houses of the northeast corner were demolished, and a stadium with parking was constructed. A Marina was also made along the railway station.
