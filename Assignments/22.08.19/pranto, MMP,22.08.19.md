The flow chart shows the way bricks are made for the building industry and how it is delivered to consumers.

Overall, the whole process of brick production is shown in seven stages. The process starts with the digging up of clay and ends with the delivery of the bricks to the consumers.

To begin, the whole process is started with clay digging by a large digger. Then, the clay is moved onto a metal grid and with a roller's help, the clay is broken into small pieces. Next, integration is made with clay, sand and water. Then, the mixture is used for making bricks through two functions either with mould or a wire cutter.
