The map details alteration to the riverside of Youngesville of New Zealand during the period from 1980 to 2005.

Looking for an overall perspective, it is readily apparent that the Youngesville became more developed with the addition of a playing ground, mills, workshops, polyhedral buildings, park and a marina.

All trees were chopped down and buildings were demolished near the railway line to make way for skyscrapers. The woodland next to the airport was removed and replaced by factories. Warehouse and factories had been built in the south of the River Alanah where trees and apartments around the school used to be. No trees were remained in the south of the river.

In the north of the river, a park was installed just around the lake after a few trees were removed. Railway line was increased in the north. A stadium and a park were erected next to new railway line. A marina was also constructed along the river Alanah.
