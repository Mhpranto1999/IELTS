The map details alteration to the riverside of Youngsville of New Zealand during the period from 1980 to 2005.

Looking from an overall perspective, it is readily apparent that Youngsville became more developed with the addition of a playing ground, mills, workshops, polyhedral buildings, a park, and a marina.

All trees were chopped down and buildings were demolished near the railway line to make space for the skyscrapers. The woodland next to the airport was removed and replaced by factories. Warehouses and factories were built in the south of the River Alanah where trees and apartments around the school used to be. No trees remained in the south of the river.

In the north of the river, a park was constructed just around the lake after a few trees were removed. The railway line was increased in the north. A stadium and a park were erected next to the new railway line. A marina was also constructed along the river Alanah.
