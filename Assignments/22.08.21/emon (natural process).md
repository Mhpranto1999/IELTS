The diagram describes the different stages in the life cycle of a frog, which is an amphibian.

Overall, the natural process consists of 6 stages, starting with mating and finishing up with the development of adult frogs.

At the first stage of the process, male frog and female frog mate on the ground level. Subsequently, a female frog lays a large number of eggs floating on the water, each having an embryo and which is shown here as a frog spawn. Then these embryos hatch from the eggs and tadpoles emerge from them. In the next stage, the tadpoles bloom with limbs and tails thoroughly. Afterward, the tadpoles mature day by day to be young frogs.

Thus, their journey on the water ends and begins on the ground level. Finally, when the young frogs become mature, they come out of the water and go to the plains to mate with each other.
