The diagram describes the different stages in life cycle of a frog, which is an amphibian.

Overall, the natural process consists of 6 stages, starting with mating and finishing up with the developments of adult frog.

At the first stage of the process, male frog and female frog mate on the ground level. Subsequently, female frog lays a large number of eggs floating on the water, each having an embryo and which is shown here as frog spawn. Then these embryos hatch from the eggs and tadpoles emerge from them. In the next stage, the tadpoles blooming with limbs and tails throughly. afterwards, the tadpoles have been catalyzing day by day to be young frog.

Thus, their journey on water ends and ground level begins. Finally, when the young frogs turn into mature, at that time they went out to the water and goes to plains for mating with each other.
