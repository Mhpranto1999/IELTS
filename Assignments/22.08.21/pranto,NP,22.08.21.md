The flow chart illustrate the variation of a frog from egg to be a mature frog during its life time.

Overall, The chart showes the life cycle of frog in six distinct stages. The cycle starts with egg and ending with mature frog.

The life cycle starts with two mature frog who are meting in order to lay eggs. The eggs shown as frog spawn and the frog spawn hatches and emerges into small tadpole. In the next step tadple develops and growes legs with a long tail. Over time, tadpole becomes bigger and grow into a young frog and tail becomes shorter. Next, the young frog turnes into a mature frog being ready to leave the water and moves into the land. Finally, the mature frog finds a mate in order to lay eggs.

And completed all this steps, the life cycle of the frog will begin again.
