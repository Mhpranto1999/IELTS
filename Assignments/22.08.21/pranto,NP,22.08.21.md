The flow chart illustrates the variation of a frog from an egg to a mature frog during its lifetime.

Overall, The chart shows the life cycle of a frog in six distinct stages. The cycle starts with an egg and ends with a mature frog.

The life cycle starts with two mature frogs who mate to lay eggs. The eggs are shown as frog spawn and the frog spawn hatches and emerge into small tadpoles. In the next step, the tadpole develops and grows legs and a long tail. Over time, the tadpole becomes bigger and grows into a young frog and the tail becomes shorter. Next, the young frog turns into a mature frog being ready to leave the water and move into the land. Finally, the mature frog finds a mate to lay eggs.After completing all these steps, the life cycle of the frog will begin again.
