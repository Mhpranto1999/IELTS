Overall, the process shows that the frog life cycle is a multistep cyclical process, which consists of six main stages: it begins with laid eggs in the water and ends with the mature frog.

The process commences as it shows the spawn. The frog lays the spawn on the surface of the water. Next, the egg emerges with a small body and a medium size of the tail, at that time frog is called a tadpole. At the third stage of the cycle, the development of the tadpole begins. When the tail grows and the body becomes bigger. At the same time, the legs start to develop. After this step is completed the tadpole grows into a young frog with a wider mouth and legs that are bigger than in the previous step. Also, The tail gets smaller. Once the stage has been completed, The frog becomes mature day by day and loses the tail.
